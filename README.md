Programming Fundamentals Lab Manuals

This public repository contains the lab manuals for the subject of Programming Fundamentals taught at the Department of Computer Science, University of Engineering and Technology during Fall 2022. 
The course and its contents were prepared by Prof. Dr. Muhammad Awais Hassan from the Department of Computer Science. We have adopted a project-based pedagogical approach to teach programming to our students, which has yielded excellent results with many of our students becoming proficient programmers. Although it may seem challenging and overwhelming at times, we strongly recommend following the prescribed practice and flow for optimal outcomes.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to write us at irzam.liaqat@imtlucca.it.

Happy coding ahead! :)
